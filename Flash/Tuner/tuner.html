  <h4 align="justify">About Tuning</h4>
  <p align="justify">The first thing you should whenever you pick up the guitar to play or   practice is get it in tune. The sound of an out of tune guitar ranks up there   with the sound of fingernails scratching on a chalkboard. It can be very   discouraging to play an out of tune guitar, because nothing you play will sound   right. In fact some beginners quit playing at all because of this very reason. </p>
  <p align="justify">Tuning your guitar is something you get better at with practice. It takes   time to develop your ears to the point that you are able to fine-tune your   instrument. Once you have developed your &quot;hearing power&quot; you may hear subtle   differences in pitch that you haven't heard before. </p>
  <p align="justify">Always tune up. This means that you increase the tension of the string until   it reaches the desired tone. If you go too far loosen the string tension and   tune up again. This is much more accurate than tuning down and increases the   chances of the string staying in tune.</p>
  <p align="justify">To tune your guitar you'll need a reference pitch from another guitar, a   piano, a tuning fork, or an electronic tuner. You can get a decent tuner at any   music store for under $20. I suggest you get one if you don't already have one. </p>
  <h4 align="justify">Standard Tuning </h4>
  <p align="justify">In standard tuning your strings will be tuned to the following notes   low-to-high: E A D G B E. There are other tunings, but don't bother messing with   them unless you know what you are doing. Over 95% of all guitar music is in   standard tuning or a dropped down version of it. Some guitar players tune all   the strings down one half step. </p>
  <p align="justify">Use the audio clips to get your guitar in tune to standard tuning. Match the   pitch of each string as closely as you can. It's all right if it takes you   awhile. You'll get better with practice. One you have tuned all six strings, go   back and check them again. Sometimes you'll have to make some minor adjustments.   Remember to tune up to the correct pitch and not down</p>
