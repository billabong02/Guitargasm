<p align="justify">Alter Bridge&nbsp;is an American rock band that was formed in 2004 in&nbsp;Orlando, Florida&nbsp;by then-former&nbsp;Creed&nbsp;members, lead guitarist&nbsp;Mark Tremonti, bassist&nbsp;Brian Marshall, and drummer Scott Phillips.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_Bridge#cite_note-allmusic-0"></a>&nbsp;Lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist&nbsp;Myles Kennedy, formerly of&nbsp;The Mayfield Four&nbsp;and the touring frontman of&nbsp;Slash's&nbsp;current solo project,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_Bridge#cite_note-slash-1"></a>&nbsp;joined shortly after the band's formation. Tremonti named the group after an actual bridge that used to be located in&nbsp;Detroit, Michigan&nbsp;near his former home on&nbsp;Alter Road. The bridge led to an unsafe area, and the neighborhood children, who saw the other side of the bridge as the unknown, were forbidden to cross it. According to Tremonti, the name of the band symbolizes choice and looking to the future.</p>
<p align="justify">Despite Creed's&nbsp;multi-platinum&nbsp;success,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_Bridge#cite_note-3"></a>&nbsp;Alter Bridge arose with only gold status with their first album,&nbsp;One Day Remains, which was released on&nbsp;Wind-up Records&nbsp;in August 2004 to generally mixed to negative reviews.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_Bridge#cite_note-odr_gold-4"></a>&nbsp;Selling 750,000 copies, it peaked at #5 on theBillboard&nbsp;200&nbsp;and remained at that spot for fourteen weeks. In October 2007, after signing toUniversal Republic, the band released&nbsp;Blackbird, which received positive reviews and peaked at #13 on the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;200 and at #4 on&nbsp;Billboard's&nbsp;Rock Albums&nbsp;chart. After touring extensively over the next two years and working on other projects, Alter Bridge reconvened to work on their third album. Released in October 2010 on&nbsp;Roadrunner Records, and later self-released via&nbsp;EMI&nbsp;in North America in November 2010,&nbsp;AB III&nbsp;was met with critical acclaim and debuted at #17 on the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;200 and more successfully on other charts.&nbsp;In January 2011, the band released their first&nbsp;live album&nbsp;and&nbsp;concert film,&nbsp;Live from Amsterdam. Originally released in August 2009 exclusively on&nbsp;Amazon, it was met with two years of delays before being released in stores.</p>
<p align="justify">Alter Bridge was faced with criticism for sounding like Creed in the early part of its career.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_Bridge#cite_note-allmusic_one_day_remains-7"> </a>However, the band has since made several notable critical achievements and has been met with generally very positive reception in recent years, despite relatively low mainstream success and label support for the majority of its career. The individual band members are also known for their involvement with many notable side projects, including solo and session work, Creed, and Kennedy's collaborations with Slash and former members of&nbsp;Led Zeppelin.&nbsp;In 2009,&nbsp;Ultimate Guitar Archive&nbsp;named Alter Bridge the 36th greatest band of the decade.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_Bridge#cite_note-ultimate_guitar_36th-10"></a></p>
