<p align="justify">The&nbsp;Foo Fighters&nbsp;are an American&nbsp;alternative rock&nbsp;band originally formed in 1994 by former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl as a one-man project following the dissolution of his previous band. The band got its name from the UFOs and various aerial phenomena that were reported by Allied aircraft pilots in World War II, which were known collectively as&nbsp;foo fighters. Prior to the release of the Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album&nbsp;Foo Fighters, which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl drafted bassist&nbsp;Nate Mendel&nbsp;and drummerWilliam Goldsmith, both formerly of&nbsp;Sunny Day Real Estate, as well as fellow Nirvana touring bandmate&nbsp;Pat Smear&nbsp;as guitarist to complete the lineup. The band began with performances in&nbsp;Portland,&nbsp;Oregon&nbsp;before gaining popularity. Goldsmith quit during the recording of the group's second album,&nbsp;The Colour and the Shape&nbsp;(1997) when most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl himself. Smear's departure followed soon afterward. They were replaced by&nbsp;Taylor Hawkins&nbsp;and&nbsp;Franz Stahl, respectively, although Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album,&nbsp;There Is Nothing Left to Lose&nbsp;(1999).</p>
<p align="justify">The band briefly continued as a trio until&nbsp;Chris Shiflett&nbsp;joined as the band's third guitarist after the completion of&nbsp;There Is Nothing Left to Lose. The band released its fourth album,&nbsp;One by One, in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc&nbsp;In Your Honor&nbsp;(2005), which was split between&nbsp;acoustic&nbsp;songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album,&nbsp;Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace, in 2007. In 2010, it was confirmed that Smear had officially rejoined the band after touring with the Foo Fighters as an unofficial member between 2006 and 2009. The band's seventh and latest studio album,&nbsp;Wasting Light, was released in 2011. Over the course of the band's career, three of its albums have wonGrammy Awards&nbsp;for&nbsp;Best Rock Album, and all six albums have been nominated.</p>
