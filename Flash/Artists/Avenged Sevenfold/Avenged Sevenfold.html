<p align="justify">Avenged Sevenfold&nbsp;is an American&nbsp;rock&nbsp;band from&nbsp;Huntington Beach, California. Formed in 1999, the group consists of vocalist&nbsp;M. Shadows, lead guitarist&nbsp;Synyster Gates, rhythm guitarist&nbsp;Zacky Vengeance, bassist&nbsp;Johnny Christ.</p>
<p align="justify">Avenged Sevenfold emerged with a&nbsp;metalcore&nbsp;sound on their debut&nbsp;Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, which included primarily&nbsp;screamed&nbsp;vocals. The band changed their style on their third album and first major label release,&nbsp;City of Evil, which featured more of a&nbsp;hard rockstyle. The band continued to explore new sounds with their&nbsp;self-titled&nbsp;release and enjoyed continued mainstream success before their drummer,&nbsp;James &quot;The Rev&quot; Sullivan, died of heart disease and combined effect of drugs and alcohol in his body in 2009. Despite his death, the band continued on with help of now-former&nbsp;Dream Theater&nbsp;drummer&nbsp;Mike Portnoy and released and toured in support of their fifth album&nbsp;Nightmare&nbsp;in 2010 which debuted on the top spot of the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;200, a first for the band.</p>
<p align="justify">To date, Avenged Sevenfold has released five&nbsp;studio albums, one&nbsp;live album/compilation/DVD, and fifteen&nbsp;singles. The band themselves have received much credit for their worldwide mainstream success and were most notably proclaimed as one of the leaders and key bands in the&nbsp;New Wave of American Heavy Metal&nbsp;and were featured as second place on&nbsp;Ultimate Guitar's Top Ten Bands of the Decade.</p>
