  <h1 align="justify">PRS Guitars </h1>
  <p align="justify">If becoming the gold standard of quality in the guitar   business was a remarkable achievement for PRS, equally impressive has been its   maintaining that standard as the company has grown into a major industry   presence. While PRS&rsquo;s continuing success in this regard demands a constant   re-evaluation of materials, tools, and procedures, the bottom-line goal hasn&rsquo;t   changed since the days when Paul Smith hand-crafted his first instruments in an   upstairs loft: Build extraordinary guitars, guitars with magic.<br />
      <br />
    National   Sales and Marketing Manager Larry Urie: &ldquo;With every increase in factory size or   production output, we build in even tighter quality control to make sure our   standards remain extremely high. If anything, the quality control at PRS is   tighter than it&rsquo;s ever been.&rdquo;<br />
    <br />
    Some companies see a public relations   benefit to invoking the romance of historic guitars from the &rsquo;50s and &rsquo;60s, but   Paul Smith knows that for the people who actually designed and built those   classic instruments (people like his mentor, Ted McCarty), PR and romance were   the furthest things from their minds. Their goal was to manufacture great   instruments, period. Build a guitar whose tone inspires you to be a better   player, whose durability will get you through a thousand gigs, whose elegance   makes it an artwork in its own right. Build a guitar that players can&rsquo;t put   down, and the romance and the PR and all the rest will follow.<br />
    <br />
    Paul   Smith: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t do something just because that&rsquo;s the traditional way. If the   best possible guitar results from using a robot for one procedure and a lot of   hand-sanding or hand-inlaying for another, then that&rsquo;s how we do it. Our   tradition is a byproduct of our quality, so excellence is always the goal. We   never lose sight of that.&rdquo;<br />
    <br />
    Larry Urie adds: &ldquo;The automation and the   individual craftsmanship go together at PRS. Using automation in one area where   it produces superior results allows us to do even more handwork and detail work   in those areas where there&rsquo;s no substitute for the individual craftsman&rsquo;s eye   and skill. People who tour the factory come away amazed at how much handwork   they see, and even with the machinery, it&rsquo;s all dominated by the human element.   It&rsquo;s all about the commitment and the judgment of a highly skilled   individual.&rdquo;<br />
    <br />
    In other words, even in the age of CNC machinery, the   essence of the PRS magic still comes down to a pair of hands.<br />
    <br />
    Aside from   his family, friends, and business, one of the most important things in Paul   Smith&rsquo;s life is his music &mdash; his songwriting, guitar playing, recording, and   performing. I mention it because Paul&rsquo;s enthusiasm for killer tone and for   exhilarating music inspires a kind of top-down passion for craftsmanship that as   far as I can tell reaches to every workbench in the factory. He estimates that   80% of PRS workers are musicians; many of them gig regularly in bands. PRS   President Jack Higginbotham: &ldquo;These builders have a special kind of pride, an   individual ownership of the instruments they&rsquo;re making. Every one of them treats   each guitar as their own, because it is their own. It&rsquo;s a very personal thing   for these builders.&rdquo;<br />
    <br />
    This passion for quality affects not only the work   habits of individuals but also the structure of the whole company. Paul Smith:   &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not organized like other companies. Every PRS craftsperson is a   self-contained quality control &lsquo;department.&rsquo; They have a lot of authority over   their work, and if a guitar falls short in any way, they don&rsquo;t pass it on to the   next stage, and they make that decision themselves. They hand guitars back and   forth all the time, and they inspect everything over and over. It&rsquo;s like an old   European guild or a shop. There&rsquo;s a constant &lsquo;is this good enough?&rsquo; conversation   out there on the factory floor. So the quality control begins at the workbench.   It&rsquo;s not something we overlay or tack on. It&rsquo;s an integral, organic part of the   process, beginning with design and materials selection and going through every   single step in construction and testing.&rdquo;<br />
    <br />
    I&rsquo;ve had many conversations   with Paul Smith over the past 15 years or so, most of them beginning with his   asking &ldquo;Guess what?&rdquo; and continuing with an enthusiastic explanation of a new   discovery about tone. The latest improvement to PRS guitars could be something   as minor as the tonal effects of substituting a small part made of a different   material. Yes, Paul Smith can hear things most of us can&rsquo;t hear, or can barely   hear, but what&rsquo;s more remarkable is that the mechanical and engineering savvy of   Paul and his brilliant collaborators enables them to convert those observations   into improvements in PRS guitars &mdash; improvements you can hear and feel.<br />
    <br />
    My   son Joe is a black belt in karate. I always assumed the black belt was the end   of the road, but he explained to me that it&rsquo;s just the beginning of a new road.   I sense a similar philosophy from the people who build PRS guitars. While   players and magazine writers have been waxing eloquent for years about these   workers&rsquo; mastery of their craft, the builders see themselves as travelers only   midway on a journey of discovery. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not there yet,&rdquo; Paul explains. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a   continuing thing. We&rsquo;re never finished. It&rsquo;s the quest, the challeng</p>

  <p align="justify">e &mdash; that&rsquo;s   what brings us to the factory every day.&rdquo;<br />
    <br />
    Back when he started crafting   instruments one at a time, Paul Smith was steeped in the traditions of the great   electric guitars of the &rsquo;50s and &rsquo;60s. Today he finds himself absorbed with the   traditions of another revered company &mdash; his own. While he fondly recalls the   early days of PRS, nostalgia is not a top priority. The best way he can honor   the traditions of his own past is to look forward. At PRS, yesterday always   takes a back seat to tomorrow. Paul Smith: &ldquo;I am lucky to have an extremely   talented team &mdash; not just craftspeople and artists but marketers, salespeople,   programmers, administrators, and others &mdash; and everyone who works here feels the   same way: We want players to know that no matter how great that old PRS guitar   is, we&rsquo;re pushing for the new one to be even better.&rdquo; </p>
