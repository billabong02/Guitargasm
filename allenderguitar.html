<p align="justify">Paul Allender, lead guitarist of the band Cradle of Filth, is known for his   unique style. Paul didn&rsquo;t take any lessons when he was starting out on the   guitar. This allowed him to develop his own style very quickly. With his strict   right hand rhythm technique and his chromatic writing style, Paul Allender&rsquo;s   sound is easily identifiable.</p>
<p align="justify">Paul started playing PRS when he left Cradle of Filth and started the band,   the Blood Divine. He purchased a second hand CE-24 and used it exclusively   throughout the band&rsquo;s days and brought it with him when he rejoined Cradle of   Filth at the turn of the century. He then sent a design of his own to PRS. It   featured a purple and black sunburst on a curly maple top and replaced the   traditional bird inlays with bats for a darker but still classic PRS look. PRS   built the guitar for Allender as a private stock model, but it eventually made   it to production as an SE model.</p>
<p align="justify">The Paul Allender SE is a 24 fret guitar with gold hardware and specially   wound pickups that were designed for Paul. Paul&rsquo;s PRS guitars can be heard on   Cradle of Filth&rsquo;s new album, Godspeed on the Devil&rsquo;s Thunder.</p>
