<p align="justify">The sweet 16, PRS   Guitars new 16 watt amp, is already on retail shelves and creating quite a stir   in the musical instruments community. This new amp couples 16 watts of   cathode-biased 6v6 output tube power and includes reverb, a full TMB tone stack,   and PRS&rsquo; transparent master volume circuit. Controls include bright switch,   volume, reverb, treble, mid, bass, and master volume. All amps are hand wired in   Stevensville, Maryland using hybrid circuitry techniques for consistency and   durability.</p>
<p align="justify">The amp&rsquo;s designer, Doug Sewell, said, &ldquo;Designing the Sweet   16 was similar to writing a song; things just flowed well from start to finish.   There was a buildup of ideas, both design and manufacturing, that needed to be   implemented quickly, and things just fell together very easily. It&rsquo;s been great   to work with a team of exuberant and talented individuals and to make all of the   good techniques and ideas reality.&rdquo; </p>
<p align="justify">Great care was taken in simplifying the layout and   construction methods during the design process. This coupled with the   ever-maturing PRS amplifier parts-procurement division and production crew   enabled the Sweet 16 to be offered at a great price. The tones can run from   sparkly cleans with single coils to humbucking crunch. At the appropriate volume   set, a full range of crunching cleans are accessible using just the guitar's   volume knob, replacing the need of at least one foot pedal.</p>
<p align="justify">The Sweet 16 uses hand assembled circuit boards for   consistency and reliability. Shielded cable is used for critical signal paths,   and pots, switches, jacks, and power tube sockets are chassis mounted and   connected via flying leads. Power sections employ JJs 6V6 power tubes, which   have proven to be very rugged and reliable. They are cathode-biased to near   class A, in a push-pull configuration. This greatly assists the chime, bloom,   and rich harmonics that the amp can produce at all volumes. The four preamp   tubes include two NOS Philips 12AT7s, a JJs ECC83S, and a Tung Sol Reissue   12AX7s in locations to maximize both clean and open-sounding lower volume   settings to thick crunchiness at higher volumes.</p>
<p align="justify">Sewell commented, &ldquo;Our pre-specifications were pretty lofty,   but I like challenges. We wanted this amp to hit on all cylinders&mdash;price point,   aesthetics, and tone. From drawing on designs in my background to doing final   tone comparisons with David Grissom, all the tools were there to come up with a   winner. This amp was great fun to produce, and I think that translates. I&rsquo;m very   proud of the Sweet 16.&rdquo;</p>
