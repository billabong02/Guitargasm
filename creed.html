<p align="justify">A&nbsp;creed&nbsp;is a statement of&nbsp;belief usually&nbsp;religious belief&nbsp;or&nbsp;faith often recited as part of a religious service. The word derives from the&nbsp;Latin:&nbsp;credo&nbsp;for &quot;I believe&quot; (because the Latin translation of the&nbsp;Apostles' Creed&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Nicene Creed&nbsp;both begin with this word). A creed is sometimes referred to as a&nbsp;symbol&nbsp;(Greek:&nbsp;&sigma;&#973;&mu;&beta;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;[&nu;],&nbsp;s&yacute;mbolo[n]), signifying a &quot;token&quot; by which persons of like beliefs might recognize each other.</p>
<p align="justify">One of the most widely used creeds in&nbsp;Christianity&nbsp;is the&nbsp;Nicene Creed, first formulated in AD 325 at the&nbsp;First Council of Nicaea. It was based on Christian understanding of the&nbsp;Canonical gospels, the letters of the&nbsp;New Testament&nbsp;and to a lesser extent the&nbsp;Old Testament. Affirmation of this creed, which describes the&nbsp;Trinity, is generally taken as a fundamental test of&nbsp;orthodoxy&nbsp;for mostChristian denominations.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed#cite_note-0"></a>&nbsp;The&nbsp;Apostles' Creed&nbsp;is also broadly accepted. Some Christian denominations and other groups have rejected the&nbsp;authority of those creeds.</p>
<p align="justify">Whether Judaism is creedal has been a point of some controversy. Though some say Judaism is noncreedal in nature, others say it recognizes a single creed, the&nbsp;Shema&nbsp;which begins: &quot;Hear, O Israel: the LORD our God, the LORD is one.&quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed#cite_note-1"></a></p>
<p align="justify">Muslims&nbsp;declare the&nbsp;shahada, or testimony: &quot;I bear witness that there is no god but God, and that Muhammad is His messenger.&quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed#cite_note-2"></a></p>
