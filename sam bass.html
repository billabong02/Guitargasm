<p align="justify"><strong>PRS Guitars and Renowned NASCAR Artist Sam Bass Partner   to Support The Jeff Gordon Foundation</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Paul Reed Smith Guitars was once again able to participate in   raising awareness and funding resources for childhood cancer at this year&rsquo;s Jeff   Gordon&rsquo;s Celebrity Bowl. For the third year, PRS Guitars provided an instrument   to include as a &ldquo;Pins for Pediatrics&rdquo; raffle item. To make this year&rsquo;s offering   even more unique, &ldquo;the first officially licensed artist of NASCAR&rdquo; Sam Bass   custom-painted the raffled guitar.</p>
<p align="justify">Sam Bass commented, &quot;I was very proud to get the opportunity   to design this one-of-a-kind PRS guitar for the Jeff Gordon Foundation's   Celebrity Bowl Auction. I have enjoyed creating the looks of the race cars for   Jeff and DuPont for 17 years, and it was great to design and paint this guitar   for such a worthwhile cause. The reaction to the guitar has just been   spectacular.&quot;</p>
<p align="justify">The winner also received two tickets to see PRS Signature   Artist Carlos Santana in concert and an autographed rendering of the guitar.</p>
<p align="justify">With approximately 550 people in attendance, the eighth   annual Jeff Gordon Celebrity Bowl was held on Thursday, July 23 at Western Bowl   in Indianapolis, Indiana. The event successfully raised $250,000 for the Riley   Hospital for Children. These proceeds will be invested in lifesaving pediatric   research conducted by the hospital in partnership with Indiana University. </p>
<p align="justify">Jack Higginbotham, President of PRS Guitars, said, &ldquo;We are   happy to be part of Jeff&rsquo;s efforts for the third year. Seeing how important it   is for Jeff to make an impact in these children&rsquo;s lives makes our involvement   all the more gratifying.&rdquo;</p>
