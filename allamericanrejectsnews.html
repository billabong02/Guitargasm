<p align="justify"><strong>All-American Rejects Rock NASCAR&rsquo;s Chevy Rock &amp; Roll   400 </strong></p>
<p align="justify">Multi-platinum recording artists The All-American Rejects   will make a pit stop from their worldwide tour at Richmond International Raceway   on Saturday, September 12 to perform hits from their third album &ldquo;When the World   Comes Down.&rdquo; The band was recently selected to perform trackside during pre-race   festivities for NASCAR&rsquo;s Chevy Rock &amp; Roll 400.</p>
<p align="justify">In addition to sharing track time, albeit playing music on   track...not driving, the band will have one more thing in common with the race&rsquo;s   winner. The All-American Rejects&rsquo; guitarist Mike Kennerty will be playing a new   Mira X model PRS guitar during their pre-race concert, and the winner of the   Chevy Rock &amp; Roll 400 will win their very own custom built PRS guitar. The   custom guitar, hand crafted at PRS, has been painted to match the pace car and   is the centerpiece of the custom Rock and Roll themed race trophy created by PRS   Guitars. </p>
